# Simple Blockchain Simulation in JavaScript

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **basic blockchain simulation** built using JavaScript. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of blockchain, including block structure, hashing, chain validation, and an optional proof-of-work mechanism.

## 🚀 Features
- **Block Structure**: Each block contains an index, timestamp, transactions, previous hash, and its own hash.
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Uses the SHA-256 algorithm to secure the blockchain.
- **Blockchain Integrity Check**: Ensures that the chain is valid and tamper-proof.
- **Proof-of-Work (Optional)**: A simple mining mechanism to make block creation computationally intensive.
- **Tampering Demonstration**: Shows how altering a block invalidates the chain.

## 📂 Project Structure
```
blockchain.js   # The main JavaScript file containing the blockchain implementation
README.md       # Documentation for the project
```

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage
### **1. Clone the Repository**


### **2. Run the Script**
Make sure **Node.js** is installed, then execute:
```sh
npm i
npm run dev 
```

### **3. Expected Output**
- The blockchain with multiple blocks will be printed.
- An attempt to tamper with the chain will be detected.

## 🔧 Future Enhancements
- Implement a **peer-to-peer network** to sync the blockchain across nodes.
- Add **transactions and wallets** to simulate a real cryptocurrency.
- Improve the **proof-of-work difficulty adjustment**.
